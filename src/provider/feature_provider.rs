/// This trait defines interfaces that Provider Authors can use to abstract a particular flag
/// management system, thus enabling the use of the evaluation API by Application Authors.
///
/// Providers are the "translator" between the flag evaluation calls made in application code, and
/// the flag management system that stores flags and in some cases evaluates flags. At a minimum,
/// providers should implement some basic evaluation methods which return flag values of the
/// expected type. In addition, providers may transform the evaluation context appropriately in
/// order to be used in dynamic evaluation of their associated flag management system, provide
/// insight into why evaluation proceeded the way it did, and expose configuration options for
/// their associated flag management system. Hypothetical provider implementations might wrap a
/// vendor SDK, embed an REST client, or read flags from a local file.
